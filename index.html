                You are <strong>my first and my last thought of the day</strong>,
                the one who quietly took over my wallpaper and my lock screen.
                You are the one who heals me — both in real life and in game —
                the one who calms the storm in my head.

                You are someone I could look at for hours and never get bored of,
                because somehow, you live in my head and in my heart
                at the same time… all the time.

                and the <strong>purest soul</strong> I know.
            </p>

            <p>
                Your warmth and grace make you shine effortlessly —
                truly the most beautiful <strong>Marwadi Brahmin</strong>
                I could ever have known.

                I don’t really know how to say this without overthinking it,
                so I’ll say it simply — the way I feel it.<br><br>

                Loving you was never a loud decision.
                It happened slowly, in the smallest moments,
                until you became something familiar…
                something safe.<br><br>

                I don’t expect anything from you.
                I don’t ever want to be a burden on your happiness.
                I just want you to know that somewhere in this world,
                there is a heart that chooses you every single day —
                quietly.<br><br>

                If Christmas is about warmth,
                then you are mine.
                If it’s about home,
                then somehow, you feel like that too.<br><br>

                No matter where life takes you,
                I hope you are loved gently,
                smiled at often,
                and protected from all the heaviness
                this world carries.<br><br>

                And if one day you ever wonder
                whether you mattered deeply to someone —
                you always did.<br><br>

                Always.
            </p>

                just as soft and beautiful as tulips. 🌷<br>

                    When we play Valorant, I never count just my score.
                    I always add yours — not out of habit,
                    but because in my head, we’re already a team.<br><br>

                    You were never someone I carried.
                    You were always someone who made the game lighter.
                    Wins feel incomplete without you in them,
                    and somehow… that’s how life feels too.<br><br>

                    You’re not a burden.
                    You’re my top frag.
                    You’re my Radiant. ❤️
