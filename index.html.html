                You are **my first and my last thought of the day**, the one who took over my wallpaper and my lock screen. 
                You are **the one who heals me—in real life and in every clutch situation**—and the one who calms the storm in my head. 
                You are the beautiful reason I can stare at someone for hours and never get bored, because you are simultaneously in my head and in my heart, all the time.
